# Johsul-project Archive: Embedded Systems Coursework

This is an archival repository for the final project of an Embedded Systems course. This project was a key component of an introductory course in Embedded Systems, undertaken during the second half of 2023 at Tampere University.

## Project Overview
The goal of the project was to develop a rudimentary "Alien Shooter Game," akin to the classic "Space Invaders." Our development platform was an 8x8 RGB LED matrix, chosen for its simplicity yet potential for demonstrating core embedded system concepts.

### Objectives
- **Primary Goal:** To facilitate hands-on learning of bare-metal C programming.
- **Hardware Focus:** The project centered around the Zynq-7000 SoC. This System on Chip combines an ARM Cortex-A9 processor with an Artix-7 family FPGA, offering a rich learning experience in embedded systems design.

## Repository Contents
This repository is an archive containing exclusively the manually written source code components of the project. It's important to note the following:

- **Complementary Files:** The repository does not include additional files that are critical for deploying the project on actual hardware. As such, the codebase in its current form is not directly executable on the Zynq-7000 SoC.
- **Privacy Compliance:** In adherence to privacy norms, all personal identifiers, including student names and numbers, have been omitted from this archive.

## Disclaimer
This archive is intended purely for educational and reference purposes. It serves as a testament to the learning process in embedded systems programming, rather than a standalone, functional software product.
